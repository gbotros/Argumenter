## What is Argumenter?

Argumenter is a web app that lets you explore and interact with arguments, debates, or presentations using a smart, visual timeline. Each point or segment is shown as a dot on a timeline, and you can jump between them, see supporting and opposing arguments, and follow the flow of a discussion or video.

## What Can You Do With Argumenter?

- **See the Big Picture:**

  - The timeline shows all the main points, supporting arguments, and counterpoints as colored dots.
  - Dots grow and animate as you hover or select them, making it easy to see where you are.

- **Jump to Any Segment:**

  - Click any dot to instantly jump to that part of the argument or video.
  - Use Next/Back buttons to move through the discussion step by step.

- **Understand Context at a Glance:**

  - Hover over a dot to see a short description of that segment.
  - The color and size of each dot shows if itâ€™s a main point, supporting idea, or counterargument.

- **Watch and Read:**

  - Some segments play a specific part of a YouTube video.
  - Others show text explanations or arguments, with a timer so you can read at your own pace.

- **Share and Collaborate:**

  - Share your timeline with others using a special link.
  - Download or import timelines as files.
  - Load timelines from public GitHub files if you want to share them widely.
